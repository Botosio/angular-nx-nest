## Use Passport with NestJS
Passport.js offers different authentication mechanisms, known as Strategies, to cater to the unique authentication requirements each application has. Passport packages Strategies as individual modules, and you can choose which Strategies to employ, without creating unnecessary dependencies. The @nestjs/passport module wraps these strategies into idiomatic NestJS constructs.

### breakdown
Here's a breakdown of what these packages do:
passport: Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.
@nestjs/passport: The Passport utility module for Nest.
passport-jwt: Passport Strategy for authenticating with a JSON Web Token (JWT).
jwks-rsa: A library to retrieve RSA signing keys from a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint.
